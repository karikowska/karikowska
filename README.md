# 👋 Hi, I’m Karo!
### 🚀 About Me
  - I'm an AI/ML graduate engineer at GSK, with almost a year of industry experience with MLOps and AzureML! I'm currently working on deepening my expertise on the cloud, as well as the rest of the ML model lifecycle.
  - 😄 Pronouns: she/her
  - 🔭 I'm currently on a learning journey with:
    - Deep Learning and Computer Vision, from scratch
    - revising Pytorch!
  - 🌱 My goal this year is to build up a few projects and get a good theoretical handle on AI :)
  - 💡 I'm interested in AI/ML, and seeing how I can incorporate my hobbies into my personal projects!
  - 🎲 In my free time, I love to play video games, collect figures, learn Japanese and draw.

## 📂 Projects
- Here are a few things I'm working on or planning:
  - 🛒 [Velu - Agentic Price Scraper for Figure Collectors (Python/BeautifulSoup/Langchain/SentenceTransformers)](#)
    - An agentic price scraper that uses your wishlist to find you figure listings under budget from a selection of online stores.
  - 🎼 [Vocaloid Audio Classifier (Python/Sklearn/Pandas/Numpy)](#)
    - A 93% accurate audio classification model that classifies input songs between Vocaloid and non-Vocaloid. You can try it yourself here: https://vocaloid-classifier.streamlit.app/
  - 🤖 [Karo's Steam Dashboard (Python/SteamAPI)](#)
    - A Steam dashboard that helps you choose a video game to play when your backlog is way too big! Neat data analysis and charts will be added in the future.
  - 🛠️ [Smol AutoML (???)](#)
    - Planning to implement my own version of an end-to-end AutoML system :)
